    <p>
      This summer, I seriously considered withdrawing from any involvement in
      politics. Exhausted through overwork, incapable of productive activity, I
      found myself drifting through social networks, feeling my depression and
      exhaustion increasing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#x2018;Left-wing&#x2019; Twitter can often be a miserable, dispiriting
      zone. Earlier this year, there were some high-profile twitterstorms, in
      which particular left-identifying figures were &#x2018;called out&#x2019;
      and condemned. What these figures had said was sometimes objectionable;
      but nevertheless, the way in which they were personally vilified and
      hounded left a horrible residue: the stench of bad conscience and
      witch-hunting moralism. The reason I didn&#x2019;t speak out on any of
      these incidents, I&#x2019;m ashamed to say, was fear. The bullies were in
      another part of the playground. I didn&#x2019;t want to attract their
      attention to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The open savagery of these exchanges was accompanied by something more
      pervasive, and for that reason perhaps more debilitating: an atmosphere of
      snarky resentment. The most frequent object of this resentment is Owen
      Jones, and the attacks on Jones&#x2014;the person most responsible for
      raising class consciousness in the UK in the last few years&#x2014;were
      one of the reasons I was so dejected. If this is what happens to a
      left-winger who is actually succeeding in taking the struggle to the
      centre ground of British life, why would anyone want to follow him into
      the mainstream? Is the only way to avoid this drip-feed of abuse to remain
      in a position of impotent marginality?
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the things that broke me out of this depressive stupor was going to
      the People&#x2019;s Assembly in Ipswich, near where I live. The
      People&#x2019;s Assembly had been greeted with the usual sneers and
      snarks. This was, we were told, a useless stunt, in which media leftists,
      including Jones, were aggrandising themselves in yet another display of
      top-down celebrity culture. What actually happened at the Assembly in
      Ipswich was very different to this caricature. The first half of the
      evening&#x2014;culminating in a rousing speech by Owen Jones&#x2014;was
      certainly led by the top-table speakers. But the second half of the
      meeting saw working class activists from all over Suffolk talking to each
      other, supporting one another, sharing experiences and strategies. Far
      from being another example of hierarchical leftism, the People&#x2019;s
      Assembly was an example of how the vertical can be combined with the
      horizontal: media power and charisma could draw people who hadn&#x2019;t
      previously been to a political meeting into the room, where they could
      talk and strategise with seasoned activists. The atmosphere was
      anti-racist and anti-sexist, but refreshingly free of the paralysing
      feeling of guilt and suspicion which hangs over left-wing Twitter like an
      acrid, stifling fog.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was Russell Brand. I&#x2019;ve long been an admirer of
      Brand&#x2014;one of the few big-name comedians on the current scene to
      come from a working class background. Over the last few years, there has
      been a gradual but remorseless embourgeoisement of television comedy, with
      preposterous ultra-posh nincompoop Michael McIntyre and a dreary drizzle
      of bland graduate chancers dominating the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day before Brand&#x2019;s now-famous interview with Jeremy Paxman was
      broadcast on <em>Newsnight</em>, I had seen Brand&#x2019;s stand-up show
      <em>Messiah Complex</em> in Ipswich. The show was defiantly pro-immigrant,
      pro-communist, anti-homophobic, saturated with working class intelligence
      and not afraid to show it, and queer in the way that popular culture used
      to be (i.e.&#xA0;nothing to do with the sour-faced identitarian piety
      foisted upon us by moralisers on the post-structuralist
      &#x2018;left&#x2019;). Malcolm X, Che, politics as a psychedelic
      dismantling of existing reality: this was communism as something cool,
      sexy and proletarian, instead of a finger-wagging sermon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next night, it was clear that Brand&#x2019;s appearance had produced a
      moment of splitting. For some of us, Brand&#x2019;s forensic take-down of
      Paxman was intensely moving, miraculous; I couldn&#x2019;t remember the
      last time a person from a working class background had been given the
      space to so consummately destroy a class &#x2018;superior&#x2019; using
      intelligence and reason. This wasn&#x2019;t Johnny Rotten swearing at Bill
      Grundy&#x2014;an act of antagonism which confirmed rather than challenged
      class stereotypes. Brand had out<em>witted</em> Paxman&#x2014;and the use
      of humour was what separated Brand from the dourness of so much
      &#x2018;leftism&#x2019;. Brand makes people feel good about themselves;
      whereas the moralising left specialises in making people feed bad, and is
      not happy until their heads are bent in guilt and self-loathing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moralising left quickly ensured that the story was not about
      Brand&#x2019;s extraordinary breach of the bland conventions of mainstream
      media &#x2018;debate&#x2019;, nor about his claim that revolution was
      <em>going to happen</em>. (This last claim could only be heard by the
      cloth-eared petit-bourgeois narcissistic &#x2018;left&#x2019; as Brand
      saying that he wanted to <em>lead</em> the revolution&#x2014;something
      that they responded to with typical resentment: &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t
      need a jumped-up <em>celebrity</em> to lead <em>me</em>&#x2019;.) For the
      moralisers, the dominant story was to be about Brand&#x2019;s personal
      conduct&#x2014;specifically his sexism. In the febrile McCarthyite
      atmosphere fermented by the moralising left, remarks that could be
      construed as sexist mean that Brand <em>is</em> a sexist, which also meant
      that he <em>is</em> a misogynist. Cut and dried, finished, condemned.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is right that Brand, like any of us, should answer for his behaviour
      and the language that he uses. But such questioning should take place in
      an atmosphere of comradeship and solidarity, and probably not in public in
      the first instance&#x2014;although when Brand was questioned about sexism
      by Mehdi Hasan, he displayed exactly the kind of good-humoured humility
      that was entirely lacking in the stony faces of those who had judged him.
      &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;m sexist. But I remember my
      grandmother, the loveliest person I&#x2019;ve ever known, but she was
      racist, but I don&#x2019;t think she knew. I don&#x2019;t know if I have
      some cultural hangover, I know that I have a great love of proletariat
      linguistics, like &#x201C;darling&#x201D; and &#x201C;bird&#x201D;, so if
      women think I&#x2019;m sexist they&#x2019;re in a better position to judge
      than I am, so I&#x2019;ll work on that.&#x2019;
    </p>
    <p>
      Brand&#x2019;s intervention was not a bid for leadership; it was an
      inspiration, a call to arms. And I for one was inspired. Where a few
      months before, I would have stayed silent as the PoshLeft moralisers
      subjected Brand to their kangaroo courts and character
      assassinations&#x2014;with &#x2018;evidence&#x2019; usually gleaned from
      the right-wing press, always available to lend a hand&#x2014;this time I
      was prepared to take them on. The response to Brand quickly became as
      significant as the Paxman exchange itself. As Laura Oldfield Ford pointed
      out, this was a clarifying moment. And one of the things that was
      clarified for me was the way in which, in recent years, so much of the
      self-styled &#x2018;left&#x2019; has suppressed the question of class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Class consciousness is fragile and fleeting. The petit bourgeoisie which
      dominates the academy and the culture industry has all kinds of subtle
      deflections and pre-emptions which prevent the topic even coming up, and
      then, if it does come up, they make one think it is a terrible
      impertinence, a breach of etiquette, to raise it. I&#x2019;ve been
      speaking now at left-wing, anti-capitalist events for years, but
      I&#x2019;ve rarely talked&#x2014;or been asked to talk&#x2014;about class
      in public.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, once class had re-appeared, it was impossible not to see it
      everywhere in the response to the Brand affair. Brand was quickly judged
      and/or questioned by at least three ex-private school people on the left.
      Others told us that Brand couldn&#x2019;t really be working class, because
      he was a millionaire. It&#x2019;s alarming how many
      &#x2018;leftists&#x2019; seemed to fundamentally agree with the drift
      behind Paxman&#x2019;s question: &#x2018;What gives this working class
      person the authority to speak?&#x2019; It&#x2019;s also alarming, actually
      distressing, that they seem to think that working class people should
      remain in poverty, obscurity and impotence lest they lose their
      &#x2018;authenticity&#x2019;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Someone passed me a post written about Brand on Facebook. I don&#x2019;t
      know the individual who wrote it, and I wouldn&#x2019;t wish to name them.
      What&#x2019;s important is that the post was symptomatic of a set of
      snobbish and condescending attitudes that it is apparently alright to
      exhibit while still classifying oneself as left wing. The whole tone was
      horrifyingly high-handed, as if they were a schoolteacher marking a
      child&#x2019;s work, or a psychiatrist assessing a patient. Brand,
      apparently, is &#x2018;clearly extremely unstable&#xA0;&#x2026; one bad
      relationship or career knockback away from collapsing back into drug
      addiction or worse&#x2019;. Although the person claims that they
      &#x2018;really quite like [Brand]&#x2019;, it perhaps never occurs to them
      that one of the reasons that Brand might be &#x2018;unstable&#x2019; is
      just this sort of patronising faux-transcendent &#x2018;assessment&#x2019;
      from the &#x2018;left&#x2019; bourgeoisie. There&#x2019;s also a shocking
      but revealing aside where the individual casually refers to Brand&#x2019;s
      &#x2018;patchy education [and] the often wince-inducing vocab slips
      characteristic of the auto-didact&#x2019;&#x2014;which, this individual
      generously says, &#x2018;I have no problem with at all&#x2019;&#x2014;how
      very good of them! This isn&#x2019;t some colonial bureaucrat writing
      about his attempts to teach some &#x2018;natives&#x2019; the English
      language in the nineteenth century, or a Victorian schoolmaster at some
      private institution describing a scholarship boy, it&#x2019;s a
      &#x2018;leftist&#x2019; writing a few weeks ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where to go from here? It is first of all necessary to identify the
      features of the discourses and the desires which have led us to this grim
      and demoralising pass, where class has disappeared, but moralism is
      everywhere, where solidarity is impossible, but guilt and fear are
      omnipresent&#x2014;and not because we are terrorised by the right, but
      because we have allowed bourgeois modes of subjectivity to contaminate our
      movement. I think there are two libidinal-discursive configurations which
      have brought this situation about. They call themselves left wing,
      but&#x2014;as the Brand episode has made clear&#x2014;they are in many
      ways a sign that the left&#x2014;defined as an agent in a class
      struggle&#x2014;has all but disappeared.
    </p>
    <h2>Inside the Vampires&#x2019; Castle</h2>
    <p>
      The first configuration is what I came to call the Vampires&#x2019;
      Castle. The Vampires&#x2019; Castle specialises in propagating guilt. It
      is driven by a <em>priest&#x2019;s desire</em> to excommunicate and
      condemn, an <em>academic-pedant&#x2019;s desire</em> to be the first to be
      seen to spot a mistake, and a <em>hipster&#x2019;s desire</em> to be one
      of the in-crowd. The danger in attacking the Vampires&#x2019; Castle is
      that it can look as if&#x2014;and it will do everything it can to
      reinforce this thought&#x2014;one is also attacking the struggles against
      racism, sexism, heterosexism. But, far from being the only legitimate
      expression of such struggles, the Vampires&#x2019; Castle is best
      understood as a bourgeois-liberal perversion and appropriation of the
      energy of these movements. The Vampires&#x2019; Castle was born the moment
      when the struggle <em>not</em> to be defined by identitarian categories
      became the quest to have &#x2018;identities&#x2019; recognised by a
      bourgeois big Other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The privilege I certainly enjoy as a white male consists in part in my not
      being aware of my ethnicity and my gender, and it is a sobering and
      revelatory experience to occasionally be made aware of these blind-spots.
      But, rather than seeking a world in which everyone achieves freedom from
      identitarian classification, the Vampires&#x2019; Castle seeks to corral
      people back into identi-camps, where they are forever defined in the terms
      set by dominant power, crippled by self-consciousness and isolated by a
      logic of solipsism which insists that we cannot understand one another
      unless we belong to the same identity group.
    </p>
    <p>
      I&#x2019;ve noticed a fascinating magical inversion projection-disavowal
      mechanism whereby the sheer mention of class is now automatically treated
      as if that means one is trying to downgrade the importance of race and
      gender. In fact, the exact opposite is the case, as the Vampires&#x2019;
      Castle uses an ultimately liberal understanding of race and gender to
      obfuscate class. In all of the absurd and traumatic twitterstorms about
      privilege earlier this year it was noticeable that the discussion of
      <em>class</em> privilege was entirely absent. The task, as ever, remains
      the articulation of class, gender and race&#x2014;but the founding move of
      the Vampires&#x2019; Castle is the <em>dis</em>-articulation of class from
      other categories.
    </p>
    <p>
      The problem that the Vampires&#x2019; Castle was set up to solve is this:
      how do you hold immense wealth and power while also appearing as a victim,
      marginal and oppositional? The solution was already there&#x2014;in the
      Christian Church. So the VC has recourse to all the infernal strategies,
      dark pathologies and psychological torture instruments Christianity
      invented, and which Nietzsche described in
      <em>The Genealogy of Morals</em>. This priesthood of bad conscience, this
      nest of pious guilt-mongers, is exactly what Nietzsche predicted when he
      said that something worse than Christianity was already on the way. Now,
      here it is&#x2026;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Vampires&#x2019; Castle feeds on the energy and anxieties and
      vulnerabilities of young students, but most of all it lives by converting
      the suffering of particular groups&#x2014;the more
      &#x2018;marginal&#x2019; the better&#x2014;into academic capital. The most
      lauded figures in the Vampires&#x2019; Castle are those who have spotted a
      new market in suffering&#x2014;those who can find a group more oppressed
      and subjugated than any previously exploited will find themselves promoted
      through the ranks very quickly.

        >The first law of the Vampires&#x2019; Castle is: individualise and
        privatise everything.</strong
      >
      While <em>in theory</em> it claims to be in favour of structural critique,
      <em>in practice</em> it never focuses on anything except individual
      behaviour. Some of these working class types are not terribly well brought
      up, and can be very rude at times. Remember: condemning individuals is
      always more important than paying attention to impersonal structures. The
      actual ruling class propagates ideologies of individualism, while tending
      to <em>act</em> as a class. (Many of what we call
      &#x2018;conspiracies&#x2019; are the ruling class showing class
      solidarity.) The VC, as a dupe-servant of the ruling class, does the
      opposite: it pays lip service to &#x2018;solidarity&#x2019; and
      &#x2018;collectivity&#x2019;, while always acting as if the individualist
      categories imposed by power really hold. Because they are petit-bourgeois
      to the core, the members of the Vampires&#x2019; Castle are intensely
      competitive, but this is repressed in the passive aggressive manner
      typical of the bourgeoisie. What holds them together is not solidarity,
      but mutual fear&#x2014;the fear that they will be the next one to be
      outed, exposed, condemned.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >The second law of the Vampires&#x2019; Castle is: make thought and
        action appear very, very difficult</strong
      >. There must be no lightness, and certainly no humour. Humour
      isn&#x2019;t serious, by definition, right? Thought is hard work, for
      people with posh voices and furrowed brows. Where there is confidence,
      introduce scepticism. Say: don&#x2019;t be hasty, we have to think more
      deeply about this. Remember: having convictions is oppressive, and might
      lead to gulags.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >The third law of the Vampires&#x2019; Castle is: propagate as much
        guilt as you can.</strong
      >
      The more guilt the better. People must feel bad: it is a sign that they
      understand the gravity of things. It&#x2019;s OK to be class-privileged if
      you feel guilty about privilege and make others in a subordinate class
      position to you feel guilty too. You do some good works for the poor, too,
      right?
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >The fourth law of the Vampires&#x2019; Castle is: essentialize.</strong
      >
      While fluidity of identity, plurality and multiplicity are always claimed
      on behalf of the VC members&#x2014;partly to cover up their own invariably
      wealthy, privileged or bourgeois-assimilationist background&#x2014;the
      enemy is always to be essentialized. Since the desires animating the VC
      are in large part priests&#x2019; desires to excommunicate and condemn,
      there has to be a strong distinction between Good and Evil, with the
      latter essentialized. Notice the tactics. X has made a remark&#xA0;/ has
      behaved in a particular way&#x2014;these remarks&#xA0;/ this behaviour
      might be construed as transphobic&#xA0;/ sexist etc. So far, OK. But
      it&#x2019;s the next move which is the kicker. X then becomes defined
      <em>as</em> a transphobe&#xA0;/ sexist etc. Their whole identity becomes
      defined by one ill-judged remark or behavioural slip. Once the VC has
      mustered its witch-hunt, the victim (often from a working class
      background, and not schooled in the passive aggressive etiquette of the
      bourgeoisie) can reliably be goaded into losing their temper, further
      securing their position as pariah&#xA0;/ latest to be consumed in the
      feeding frenzy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >The fifth law of the Vampires&#x2019; Castle is: think like a liberal
        (because you are one).</strong
      >
      The VC&#x2019;s work of constantly stoking up reactive outrage consists of
      endlessly pointing out the screamingly obvious: capital behaves like
      capital (it&#x2019;s not very nice!), repressive state apparatuses are
      repressive. We must protest!
    </p>
    <h2>Neo-anarchy in the UK</h2>
    <p>
      The second libidinal formation is neo-anarchism. By neo-anarchists I
      definitely do not mean anarchists or syndicalists involved in actual
      workplace organisation, such as the Solidarity Federation. I mean, rather,
      those who identify as anarchists but whose involvement in politics extends
      little beyond student protests and occupations, and commenting on Twitter.
      Like the denizens of the Vampires&#x2019; Castle, neo-anarchists usually
      come from a petit-bourgeois background, if not from somewhere even more
      class-privileged.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are also overwhelmingly young: in their twenties or at most their
      early thirties, and what informs the neo-anarchist position is a narrow
      historical horizon. Neo-anarchists have experienced nothing but capitalist
      realism. By the time the neo-anarchists had come to political
      consciousness&#x2014;and many of them have come to political consciousness
      remarkably recently, given the level of bullish swagger they sometimes
      display&#x2014;the Labour Party had become a Blairite shell, implementing
      neo-liberalism with a small dose of social justice on the side. But the
      problem with neo-anarchism is that it unthinkingly reflects this
      historical moment rather than offering any escape from it. It forgets, or
      perhaps is genuinely unaware of, the Labour Party&#x2019;s role in
      nationalising major industries and utilities or founding the National
      Health Service. Neo-anarchists will assert that &#x2018;parliamentary
      politics never changed anything&#x2019;, or &#x2018;the Labour Party was
      always useless&#x2019; while attending protests about the NHS, or
      retweeting complaints about the dismantling of what remains of the welfare
      state. There&#x2019;s a strange implicit rule here: it&#x2019;s OK to
      protest against what Parliament has done, but it&#x2019;s not alright to
      enter into Parliament or the mass media to attempt to engineer change from
      there. Mainstream media is to be disdained, but BBC
      <em>Question Time</em> is to be watched and moaned about on Twitter.
      Purism shades into fatalism; better not to be in any way tainted by the
      corruption of the mainstream, better to uselessly &#x2018;resist&#x2019;
      than to risk getting your hands dirty.
    </p>
    <p>
      It&#x2019;s not surprising, then, that so many neo-anarchists come across
      as depressed. This depression is no doubt reinforced by the anxieties of
      postgraduate life, since, like the Vampires&#x2019; Castle, neo-anarchism
      has its natural home in universities, and is usually propagated by those
      studying for postgraduate qualifications, or those who have recently
      graduated from such study.
    </p>
    <h2>What is to be done?</h2>
    <p>
      Why have these two configurations come to the fore? The first reason is
      that they have been allowed to prosper by capital because they serve its
      interests. Capital subdued the organised working class by decomposing
      class consciousness, viciously subjugating trade unions while seducing
      &#x2018;hard working families&#x2019; into identifying with their own
      narrowly defined interests instead of the interests of the wider class;
      but why would capital be concerned about a &#x2018;left&#x2019; that
      replaces class politics with a moralising individualism, and that, far
      from building solidarity, spreads fear and insecurity?
    </p>
    <p>
      The second reason is what Jodi Dean has called &#x2018;communicative
      capitalism&#x2019;. It might have been possible to ignore the
      Vampires&#x2019; Castle and the neo-anarchists if it weren&#x2019;t for
      capitalist cyberspace. The VC&#x2019;s pious moralising has been a feature
      of a certain &#x2018;left&#x2019; for many years&#x2014;but, if one
      wasn&#x2019;t a member of this particular church, its sermons could be
      avoided. Social media means that this is no longer the case, and there is
      little protection from the psychic pathologies propagated by these
      discourses.
    </p>
    <p>
      So what can we do now? First of all, it is imperative to reject
      identitarianism, and to recognise that there are no identities, only
      desires, interests and identifications. Part of the importance of the
      British Cultural Studies project&#x2014;as revealed so powerfully and so
      movingly in John Akomfrah&#x2019;s installation
      <em>The Unfinished Conversation</em> (currently in Tate Britain) and his
      film <em>The Stuart Hall Project</em>&#x2014;was to have resisted
      identitarian essentialism. Instead of freezing people into chains of
      already-existing equivalences, the point was to treat any articulation as
      provisional and plastic. New articulations can always be created. No-one
      is essentially anything. Sadly, the right acts on this insight more
      effectively than the left does. The bourgeois-identitarian left knows how
      to propagate guilt and conduct a witch hunt, but it doesn&#x2019;t know
      how to make converts. But that, after all, is not the point. The aim is
      not to popularise a leftist position, or to win people over to it, but to
      remain in a position of elite superiority, but now with class superiority
      redoubled by <em>moral</em> superiority too. &#x2018;How dare you
      talk&#x2014;it&#x2019;s we who speak for those who suffer!&#x2019;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the rejection of identitarianism can only be achieved by the
      reassertion of class. A left that does not have class at its core can only
      be a liberal pressure group. Class consciousness is always double: it
      involves a simultaneous knowledge of the way in which class frames and
      shapes all experience, and a knowledge of the particular position that we
      occupy in the class structure. It must be remembered that the aim of our
      struggle is not recognition by the bourgeoisie, nor even the destruction
      of the bourgeoisie itself. It is the class structure&#x2014;a structure
      that wounds everyone, even those who materially profit from it&#x2014;that
      must be destroyed. The interests of the working class are the interests of
      all; the interests of the bourgeoisie are the interests of capital, which
      are the interests of no-one. Our struggle must be towards the construction
      of a new and surprising world, not the preservation of identities shaped
      and distorted by capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      If this seems like a forbidding and daunting task, it is. But we can start
      to engage in many prefigurative activities right now. Actually, such
      activities would go beyond prefiguration&#x2014;they could start a
      virtuous cycle, a self-fulfilling prophecy in which bourgeois modes of
      subjectivity are dismantled and a new universality starts to build itself.
      We need to learn, or re-learn, how to build comradeship and solidarity
      instead of doing capital&#x2019;s work for it by condemning and abusing
      each other. This doesn&#x2019;t mean, of course, that we must always
      agree&#x2014;on the contrary, we must create conditions where disagreement
      can take place without fear of exclusion and excommunication.
    </p>
    <p>
      We need to think very strategically about how to use social
      media&#x2014;always remembering that, despite the egalitarianism claimed
      for social media by capital&#x2019;s libidinal engineers, this is
      currently an enemy territory, dedicated to the reproduction of capital.
      But this doesn&#x2019;t mean that we can&#x2019;t occupy the terrain and
      start to use it for the purposes of producing class consciousness. We must
      break out of the &#x2018;debate&#x2019; set up by communicative
      capitalism, in which capital is endlessly cajoling us to participate, and
      remember that we are involved in a class struggle. The goal is not to
      &#x2018;be&#x2019; an activist, but to aid the working class to
      activate&#x2014;and transform&#x2014;itself. Outside the Vampires&#x2019;
      Castle, anything is possible.
