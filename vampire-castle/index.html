    <p>
      This summer, I seriously considered withdrawing from any involvement in
      politics. Exhausted through overwork, incapable of productive activity, I
      found myself drifting through social networks, feeling my depression and
      exhaustion increasing.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Left-wing’ Twitter can often be a miserable, dispiriting zone. Earlier
      this year, there were some high-profile twitterstorms, in which particular
      left-identifying figures were ‘called out’ and condemned. What these
      figures had said was sometimes objectionable; but nevertheless, the way in
      which they were personally vilified and hounded left a horrible residue:
      the stench of bad conscience and witch-hunting moralism. The reason I
      didn’t speak out on any of these incidents, I’m ashamed to say, was fear.
      The bullies were in another part of the playground. I didn’t want to
      attract their attention to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The open savagery of these exchanges was accompanied by something more
      pervasive, and for that reason perhaps more debilitating: an atmosphere of
      snarky resentment. The most frequent object of this resentment is Owen
      Jones, and the attacks on Jones—the person most responsible for raising
      class consciousness in the UK in the last few years—were one of the
      reasons I was so dejected. If this is what happens to a left-winger who is
      actually succeeding in taking the struggle to the centre ground of British
      life, why would anyone want to follow him into the mainstream? Is the only
      way to avoid this drip-feed of abuse to remain in a position of impotent
      marginality?
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the things that broke me out of this depressive stupor was going to
      the People’s Assembly in Ipswich, near where I live. The People’s Assembly
      had been greeted with the usual sneers and snarks. This was, we were told,
      a useless stunt, in which media leftists, including Jones, were
      aggrandising themselves in yet another display of top-down celebrity
      culture. What actually happened at the Assembly in Ipswich was very
      different to this caricature. The first half of the evening—culminating in
      a rousing speech by Owen Jones—was certainly led by the top-table
      speakers. But the second half of the meeting saw working class activists
      from all over Suffolk talking to each other, supporting one another,
      sharing experiences and strategies. Far from being another example of
      hierarchical leftism, the People’s Assembly was an example of how the
      vertical can be combined with the horizontal: media power and charisma
      could draw people who hadn’t previously been to a political meeting into
      the room, where they could talk and strategise with seasoned activists.
      The atmosphere was anti-racist and anti-sexist, but refreshingly free of
      the paralysing feeling of guilt and suspicion which hangs over left-wing
      Twitter like an acrid, stifling fog.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was Russell Brand. I’ve long been an admirer of Brand—one of
      the few big-name comedians on the current scene to come from a working
      class background. Over the last few years, there has been a gradual but
      remorseless embourgeoisement of television comedy, with preposterous
      ultra-posh nincompoop Michael McIntyre and a dreary drizzle of bland
      graduate chancers dominating the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day before Brand’s now-famous interview with Jeremy Paxman was
      broadcast on <em>Newsnight</em>, I had seen Brand’s stand-up show
      <em>Messiah Complex</em> in Ipswich. The show was defiantly pro-immigrant,
      pro-communist, anti-homophobic, saturated with working class intelligence
      and not afraid to show it, and queer in the way that popular culture used
      to be (i.e. nothing to do with the sour-faced identitarian piety foisted
      upon us by moralisers on the post-structuralist ‘left’). Malcolm X, Che,
      politics as a psychedelic dismantling of existing reality: this was
      communism as something cool, sexy and proletarian, instead of a
      finger-wagging sermon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next night, it was clear that Brand’s appearance had produced a moment
      of splitting. For some of us, Brand’s forensic take-down of Paxman was
      intensely moving, miraculous; I couldn’t remember the last time a person
      from a working class background had been given the space to so
      consummately destroy a class ‘superior’ using intelligence and reason.
      This wasn’t Johnny Rotten swearing at Bill Grundy—an act of antagonism
      which confirmed rather than challenged class stereotypes. Brand had out<em
        >witted</em
      >
      Paxman—and the use of humour was what separated Brand from the dourness of
      so much ‘leftism’. Brand makes people feel good about themselves; whereas
      the moralising left specialises in making people feed bad, and is not
      happy until their heads are bent in guilt and self-loathing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moralising left quickly ensured that the story was not about Brand’s
      extraordinary breach of the bland conventions of mainstream media
      ‘debate’, nor about his claim that revolution was
      <em>going to happen</em>. (This last claim could only be heard by the
      cloth-eared petit-bourgeois narcissistic ‘left’ as Brand saying that he
      wanted to <em>lead</em> the revolution—something that they responded to
      with typical resentment: ‘I don’t need a jumped-up <em>celebrity</em> to
      lead <em>me</em>’.) For the moralisers, the dominant story was to be about
      Brand’s personal conduct—specifically his sexism. In the febrile
      McCarthyite atmosphere fermented by the moralising left, remarks that
      could be construed as sexist mean that Brand <em>is</em> a sexist, which
      also meant that he <em>is</em> a misogynist. Cut and dried, finished,
      condemned.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is right that Brand, like any of us, should answer for his behaviour
      and the language that he uses. But such questioning should take place in
      an atmosphere of comradeship and solidarity, and probably not in public in
      the first instance—although when Brand was questioned about sexism by
      Mehdi Hasan, he displayed exactly the kind of good-humoured humility that
      was entirely lacking in the stony faces of those who had judged him. ‘I
      don’t think I’m sexist. But I remember my grandmother, the loveliest
      person I’ve ever known, but she was racist, but I don’t think she knew. I
      don’t know if I have some cultural hangover, I know that I have a great
      love of proletariat linguistics, like “darling” and “bird”, so if women
      think I’m sexist they’re in a better position to judge than I am, so I’ll
      work on that.’
    </p>
    <p>
      Brand’s intervention was not a bid for leadership; it was an inspiration,
      a call to arms. And I for one was inspired. Where a few months before, I
      would have stayed silent as the PoshLeft moralisers subjected Brand to
      their kangaroo courts and character assassinations—with ‘evidence’ usually
      gleaned from the right-wing press, always available to lend a hand—this
      time I was prepared to take them on. The response to Brand quickly became
      as significant as the Paxman exchange itself. As Laura Oldfield Ford
      pointed out, this was a clarifying moment. And one of the things that was
      clarified for me was the way in which, in recent years, so much of the
      self-styled ‘left’ has suppressed the question of class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Class consciousness is fragile and fleeting. The petit bourgeoisie which
      dominates the academy and the culture industry has all kinds of subtle
      deflections and pre-emptions which prevent the topic even coming up, and
      then, if it does come up, they make one think it is a terrible
      impertinence, a breach of etiquette, to raise it. I’ve been speaking now
      at left-wing, anti-capitalist events for years, but I’ve rarely talked—or
      been asked to talk—about class in public.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, once class had re-appeared, it was impossible not to see it
      everywhere in the response to the Brand affair. Brand was quickly judged
      and/or questioned by at least three ex-private school people on the left.
      Others told us that Brand couldn’t really be working class, because he was
      a millionaire. It’s alarming how many ‘leftists’ seemed to fundamentally
      agree with the drift behind Paxman’s question: ‘What gives this working
      class person the authority to speak?’ It’s also alarming, actually
      distressing, that they seem to think that working class people should
      remain in poverty, obscurity and impotence lest they lose their
      ‘authenticity’.
    </p>
    <p>
      Someone passed me a post written about Brand on Facebook. I don’t know the
      individual who wrote it, and I wouldn’t wish to name them. What’s
      important is that the post was symptomatic of a set of snobbish and
      condescending attitudes that it is apparently alright to exhibit while
      still classifying oneself as left wing. The whole tone was horrifyingly
      high-handed, as if they were a schoolteacher marking a child’s work, or a
      psychiatrist assessing a patient. Brand, apparently, is ‘clearly extremely
      unstable … one bad relationship or career knockback away from collapsing
      back into drug addiction or worse’. Although the person claims that they
      ‘really quite like [Brand]’, it perhaps never occurs to them that one of
      the reasons that Brand might be ‘unstable’ is just this sort of
      patronising faux-transcendent ‘assessment’ from the ‘left’ bourgeoisie.
      There’s also a shocking but revealing aside where the individual casually
      refers to Brand’s ‘patchy education [and] the often wince-inducing vocab
      slips characteristic of the auto-didact’—which, this individual generously
      says, ‘I have no problem with at all’—how very good of them! This isn’t
      some colonial bureaucrat writing about his attempts to teach some
      ‘natives’ the English language in the nineteenth century, or a Victorian
      schoolmaster at some private institution describing a scholarship boy,
      it’s a ‘leftist’ writing a few weeks ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where to go from here? It is first of all necessary to identify the
      features of the discourses and the desires which have led us to this grim
      and demoralising pass, where class has disappeared, but moralism is
      everywhere, where solidarity is impossible, but guilt and fear are
      omnipresent—and not because we are terrorised by the right, but because we
      have allowed bourgeois modes of subjectivity to contaminate our movement.
      I think there are two libidinal-discursive configurations which have
      brought this situation about. They call themselves left wing, but—as the
      Brand episode has made clear—they are in many ways a sign that the
      left—defined as an agent in a class struggle—has all but disappeared.
    </p>
    <h2>Inside the Vampires’ Castle</h2>
    <p>
      The first configuration is what I came to call the Vampires’ Castle. The
      Vampires’ Castle specialises in propagating guilt. It is driven by a
      <em>priest’s desire</em> to excommunicate and condemn, an
      <em>academic-pedant’s desire</em> to be the first to be seen to spot a
      mistake, and a <em>hipster’s desire</em> to be one of the in-crowd. The
      danger in attacking the Vampires’ Castle is that it can look as if—and it
      will do everything it can to reinforce this thought—one is also attacking
      the struggles against racism, sexism, heterosexism. But, far from being
      the only legitimate expression of such struggles, the Vampires’ Castle is
      best understood as a bourgeois-liberal perversion and appropriation of the
      energy of these movements. The Vampires’ Castle was born the moment when
      the struggle <em>not</em> to be defined by identitarian categories became
      the quest to have ‘identities’ recognised by a bourgeois big Other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The privilege I certainly enjoy as a white male consists in part in my not
      being aware of my ethnicity and my gender, and it is a sobering and
      revelatory experience to occasionally be made aware of these blind-spots.
      But, rather than seeking a world in which everyone achieves freedom from
      identitarian classification, the Vampires’ Castle seeks to corral people
      back into identi-camps, where they are forever defined in the terms set by
      dominant power, crippled by self-consciousness and isolated by a logic of
      solipsism which insists that we cannot understand one another unless we
      belong to the same identity group.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve noticed a fascinating magical inversion projection-disavowal
      mechanism whereby the sheer mention of class is now automatically treated
      as if that means one is trying to downgrade the importance of race and
      gender. In fact, the exact opposite is the case, as the Vampires’ Castle
      uses an ultimately liberal understanding of race and gender to obfuscate
      class. In all of the absurd and traumatic twitterstorms about privilege
      earlier this year it was noticeable that the discussion of
      <em>class</em> privilege was entirely absent. The task, as ever, remains
      the articulation of class, gender and race—but the founding move of the
      Vampires’ Castle is the <em>dis</em>-articulation of class from other
      categories.
    </p>
    <p>
      The problem that the Vampires’ Castle was set up to solve is this: how do
      you hold immense wealth and power while also appearing as a victim,
      marginal and oppositional? The solution was already there—in the Christian
      Church. So the VC has recourse to all the infernal strategies, dark
      pathologies and psychological torture instruments Christianity invented,
      and which Nietzsche described in <em>The Genealogy of Morals</em>. This
      priesthood of bad conscience, this nest of pious guilt-mongers, is exactly
      what Nietzsche predicted when he said that something worse than
      Christianity was already on the way. Now, here it is…
    </p>
    <p>
      The Vampires’ Castle feeds on the energy and anxieties and vulnerabilities
      of young students, but most of all it lives by converting the suffering of
      particular groups—the more ‘marginal’ the better—into academic capital.
      The most lauded figures in the Vampires’ Castle are those who have spotted
      a new market in suffering—those who can find a group more oppressed and
      subjugated than any previously exploited will find themselves promoted
      through the ranks very quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >The first law of the Vampires’ Castle is: individualise and privatise
        everything.</strong
      >
      While <em>in theory</em> it claims to be in favour of structural critique,
      <em>in practice</em> it never focuses on anything except individual
      behaviour. Some of these working class types are not terribly well brought
      up, and can be very rude at times. Remember: condemning individuals is
      always more important than paying attention to impersonal structures. The
      actual ruling class propagates ideologies of individualism, while tending
      to <em>act</em> as a class. (Many of what we call ‘conspiracies’ are the
      ruling class showing class solidarity.) The VC, as a dupe-servant of the
      ruling class, does the opposite: it pays lip service to ‘solidarity’ and
      ‘collectivity’, while always acting as if the individualist categories
      imposed by power really hold. Because they are petit-bourgeois to the
      core, the members of the Vampires’ Castle are intensely competitive, but
      this is repressed in the passive aggressive manner typical of the
      bourgeoisie. What holds them together is not solidarity, but mutual
      fear—the fear that they will be the next one to be outed, exposed,
      condemned.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >The second law of the Vampires’ Castle is: make thought and action
        appear very, very difficult</strong
      >. There must be no lightness, and certainly no humour. Humour isn’t
      serious, by definition, right? Thought is hard work, for people with posh
      voices and furrowed brows. Where there is confidence, introduce
      scepticism. Say: don’t be hasty, we have to think more deeply about this.
      Remember: having convictions is oppressive, and might lead to gulags.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >The third law of the Vampires’ Castle is: propagate as much guilt as
        you can.</strong
      >
      The more guilt the better. People must feel bad: it is a sign that they
      understand the gravity of things. It’s OK to be class-privileged if you
      feel guilty about privilege and make others in a subordinate class
      position to you feel guilty too. You do some good works for the poor, too,
      right?
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>The fourth law of the Vampires’ Castle is: essentialize.</strong>
      While fluidity of identity, plurality and multiplicity are always claimed
      on behalf of the VC members—partly to cover up their own invariably
      wealthy, privileged or bourgeois-assimilationist background—the enemy is
      always to be essentialized. Since the desires animating the VC are in
      large part priests’ desires to excommunicate and condemn, there has to be
      a strong distinction between Good and Evil, with the latter essentialized.
      Notice the tactics. X has made a remark / has behaved in a particular
      way—these remarks / this behaviour might be construed as transphobic /
      sexist etc. So far, OK. But it’s the next move which is the kicker. X then
      becomes defined <em>as</em> a transphobe / sexist etc. Their whole
      identity becomes defined by one ill-judged remark or behavioural slip.
      Once the VC has mustered its witch-hunt, the victim (often from a working
      class background, and not schooled in the passive aggressive etiquette of
      the bourgeoisie) can reliably be goaded into losing their temper, further
      securing their position as pariah / latest to be consumed in the feeding
      frenzy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >The fifth law of the Vampires’ Castle is: think like a liberal (because
        you are one).</strong
      >
      The VC’s work of constantly stoking up reactive outrage consists of
      endlessly pointing out the screamingly obvious: capital behaves like
      capital (it’s not very nice!), repressive state apparatuses are
      repressive. We must protest!
    </p>
    <h2>Neo-anarchy in the UK</h2>
    <p>
      The second libidinal formation is neo-anarchism. By neo-anarchists I
      definitely do not mean anarchists or syndicalists involved in actual
      workplace organisation, such as the Solidarity Federation. I mean, rather,
      those who identify as anarchists but whose involvement in politics extends
      little beyond student protests and occupations, and commenting on Twitter.
      Like the denizens of the Vampires’ Castle, neo-anarchists usually come
      from a petit-bourgeois background, if not from somewhere even more
      class-privileged.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are also overwhelmingly young: in their twenties or at most their
      early thirties, and what informs the neo-anarchist position is a narrow
      historical horizon. Neo-anarchists have experienced nothing but capitalist
      realism. By the time the neo-anarchists had come to political
      consciousness—and many of them have come to political consciousness
      remarkably recently, given the level of bullish swagger they sometimes
      display—the Labour Party had become a Blairite shell, implementing
      neo-liberalism with a small dose of social justice on the side. But the
      problem with neo-anarchism is that it unthinkingly reflects this
      historical moment rather than offering any escape from it. It forgets, or
      perhaps is genuinely unaware of, the Labour Party’s role in nationalising
      major industries and utilities or founding the National Health Service.
      Neo-anarchists will assert that ‘parliamentary politics never changed
      anything’, or ‘the Labour Party was always useless’ while attending
      protests about the NHS, or retweeting complaints about the dismantling of
      what remains of the welfare state. There’s a strange implicit rule here:
      it’s OK to protest against what Parliament has done, but it’s not alright
      to enter into Parliament or the mass media to attempt to engineer change
      from there. Mainstream media is to be disdained, but BBC
      <em>Question Time</em> is to be watched and moaned about on Twitter.
      Purism shades into fatalism; better not to be in any way tainted by the
      corruption of the mainstream, better to uselessly ‘resist’ than to risk
      getting your hands dirty.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s not surprising, then, that so many neo-anarchists come across as
      depressed. This depression is no doubt reinforced by the anxieties of
      postgraduate life, since, like the Vampires’ Castle, neo-anarchism has its
      natural home in universities, and is usually propagated by those studying
      for postgraduate qualifications, or those who have recently graduated from
      such study.
    </p>
    <h2>What is to be done?</h2>
    <p>
      Why have these two configurations come to the fore? The first reason is
      that they have been allowed to prosper by capital because they serve its
      interests. Capital subdued the organised working class by decomposing
      class consciousness, viciously subjugating trade unions while seducing
      ‘hard working families’ into identifying with their own narrowly defined
      interests instead of the interests of the wider class; but why would
      capital be concerned about a ‘left’ that replaces class politics with a
      moralising individualism, and that, far from building solidarity, spreads
      fear and insecurity?
    </p>
    <p>
      The second reason is what Jodi Dean has called ‘communicative capitalism’.
      It might have been possible to ignore the Vampires’ Castle and the
      neo-anarchists if it weren’t for capitalist cyberspace. The VC’s pious
      moralising has been a feature of a certain ‘left’ for many years—but, if
      one wasn’t a member of this particular church, its sermons could be
      avoided. Social media means that this is no longer the case, and there is
      little protection from the psychic pathologies propagated by these
      discourses.
    </p>
    <p>
      So what can we do now? First of all, it is imperative to reject
      identitarianism, and to recognise that there are no identities, only
      desires, interests and identifications. Part of the importance of the
      British Cultural Studies project—as revealed so powerfully and so movingly
      in John Akomfrah’s installation
      <em>The Unfinished Conversation</em> (currently in Tate Britain) and his
      film <em>The Stuart Hall Project</em>—was to have resisted identitarian
      essentialism. Instead of freezing people into chains of already-existing
      equivalences, the point was to treat any articulation as provisional and
      plastic. New articulations can always be created. No-one is essentially
      anything. Sadly, the right acts on this insight more effectively than the
      left does. The bourgeois-identitarian left knows how to propagate guilt
      and conduct a witch hunt, but it doesn’t know how to make converts. But
      that, after all, is not the point. The aim is not to popularise a leftist
      position, or to win people over to it, but to remain in a position of
      elite superiority, but now with class superiority redoubled by
      <em>moral</em> superiority too. ‘How dare you talk—it’s we who speak for
      those who suffer!’

      But the rejection of identitarianism can only be achieved by the
      reassertion of class. A left that does not have class at its core can only
      be a liberal pressure group. Class consciousness is always double: it
      involves a simultaneous knowledge of the way in which class frames and
      shapes all experience, and a knowledge of the particular position that we
      occupy in the class structure. It must be remembered that the aim of our
      struggle is not recognition by the bourgeoisie, nor even the destruction
      of the bourgeoisie itself. It is the class structure—a structure that
      wounds everyone, even those who materially profit from it—that must be
      destroyed. The interests of the working class are the interests of all;
      the interests of the bourgeoisie are the interests of capital, which are
      the interests of no-one. Our struggle must be towards the construction of
      a new and surprising world, not the preservation of identities shaped and
      distorted by capital.

      If this seems like a forbidding and daunting task, it is. But we can start
      to engage in many prefigurative activities right now. Actually, such
      activities would go beyond prefiguration—they could start a virtuous
      cycle, a self-fulfilling prophecy in which bourgeois modes of subjectivity
      are dismantled and a new universality starts to build itself. We need to
      learn, or re-learn, how to build comradeship and solidarity instead of
      doing capital’s work for it by condemning and abusing each other. This
      doesn’t mean, of course, that we must always agree—on the contrary, we
      must create conditions where disagreement can take place without fear of
      exclusion and excommunication.
    </p>
    <p>
      We need to think very strategically about how to use social media—always
      remembering that, despite the egalitarianism claimed for social media by
      capital’s libidinal engineers, this is currently an enemy territory,
      dedicated to the reproduction of capital. But this doesn’t mean that we
      can’t occupy the terrain and start to use it for the purposes of producing
      class consciousness. We must break out of the ‘debate’ set up by
      communicative capitalism, in which capital is endlessly cajoling us to
      participate, and remember that we are involved in a class struggle. The
      goal is not to ‘be’ an activist, but to aid the working class to
      activate—and transform—itself. Outside the Vampires’ Castle, anything is
      possible.
